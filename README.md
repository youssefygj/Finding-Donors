Project: Finding Donors for CharityML
Project Overview
Apply supervised learning techniques to help CharityML, a fictitious charity organization, identify potential donors. The project involves analyzing U.S. census data to predict individuals who are most likely to donate. Begin by exploring the data and understanding its structure. Preprocess and transform the data to make it suitable for analysis. Evaluate various supervised learning algorithms on the dataset and determine the most effective solution. Optimize the selected model and present it as the recommended solution to CharityML. Lastly, examine the model's performance and predictions to assess its effectiveness in utilizing the available data.

Project Highlights
Gain familiarity with different supervised learning algorithms in sklearn. Evaluate and compare their performance on specific datasets. Develop an understanding of when to apply certain algorithms and when to avoid them, an important aspect of machine learning.
