# Finding-Donors
In this project, I will apply supervised learning techniques and my analytical skills to help CharityML, a fictitious charity organization, identify potential donors. By analyzing data collected from the U.S. census, I will predict individuals who are most likely to donate to their cause. First, I will explore the data and understand how it is recorded. Then, I will preprocess and transform the data to make it suitable for analysis. Next, I will evaluate several supervised learning algorithms of my choice on the dataset and determine which one is best suited for the solution. Once I have selected the most promising model, I will optimize it and present it as my recommended solution to CharityML. Finally, I will delve into the chosen model's performance and predictions to gain insights into how well it is utilizing the available data.
